This program takes a path to a directory full of audio files.  It randomly shuffles the 
songs then plays them all.  It has controlls that allow you to play/pause, skip, replay, or play
the previous song.

Use `make` to compile, or `make run` to compile and run the program.

You can use `./shuffleplay` to play music from the `songs` directory.

Alternately, you can use `./shuffleplay <path>` to play music in the directory
specified by `<path>`.

Once the songs are playing, type "p" at the prompt to play/pause.

`>> p`

Type "r" to restart the current song.

`>> r`

Type "n" to skip to the next song.

`>> n`

Or type "b" to play the last song that was played.

`>> b`
